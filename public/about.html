      Hi, I’m Minh Nguyễn! <br />
      I’m a passionate Web Developer with over 5 years of experience creating
      responsive and engaging websites. I specialize in front-end development
      and love bringing design concepts to life with clean, efficient code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I graduated from University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science,
      and started my career as a junior web developer at ABC Tech. Since then,
      I’ve worked on a variety of projects, from e-commerce platforms to
      personal blogs, helping clients enhance their online presence.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Skills: <br />I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        frameworks like React.js and Vue.js. I’m also experienced in integrating
        APIs, optimizing web performance, and ensuring accessibility compliance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Core values: <br />My approach combines technical expertise with
        creativity to deliver tailored solutions that prioritize user experience
        and functionality.
      </li>

      When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new technology trends,
      playing guitar, or hiking in the countryside.
